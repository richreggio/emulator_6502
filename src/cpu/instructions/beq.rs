// BEQ - Branch on Result Zero
// Operation: Branch on Z = 1
// This instruction could also be called "Branch on Equal."
// It takes a conditional branch whenever the Z flag is on or the previÂ­ ous result is equal to 0.
// BEQ does not affect any of the flags or registers other than the program counter and only then when the Z flag is set.
// Addressing Mode	Assembly Language Form	Opcode	No. Bytes	No. Cycles
// Relative	BEQ $nnnn	$F0	2	2+t+p
// p: =1 if page is crossed.
// t: =1 if branch is taken.
